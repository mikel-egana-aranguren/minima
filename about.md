# About me


My name is Mikel Egaña Aranguren. I’m a biologist by the University of Basque Country; I also hold a PhD in computer science and an MSc in Bioinformatics, both awarded by the Univesity of Manchester, UK.

I have mainly worked in an academic setting (UM, UPM and UPV/EHU in Spain; VIB in Belgium), but also at a company called Eurohelp Consulting as a Linked Open Data developer, funded by the Torres Quevedo program. I am now working as a Bioinformatician at Biocruces, funded by ISCIII (I intend to use this Notebook to write daily notes). I have also worked as an independent consultant on Semantic Web/Open Data projects, so if you have an interesting offer please do not hesitate on contacting me.
